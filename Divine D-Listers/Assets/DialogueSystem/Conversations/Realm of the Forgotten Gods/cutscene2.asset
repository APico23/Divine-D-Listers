    dialogue: "You don\u2019t have to say much. What\u2019s on your mind? A fun fact
      about you? Do you have any deep, burning anger against anyone or anything?"

    dialogue: "\u2026 yes, actually. As I have said, I am the god of chairs. Chairs
      are my thing. And recently Odin\u2019s throne was broken by his thundering
      oaf of a son."

    dialogue: "No! It was the fact that Odin replaced it with some insane modern
      stylistic throne that is wildly impractical! There isn\u2019t even a seat man,
      it's all strings!"

    dialogue: "THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING! I am the god of chairs, I know chairs inside
      and out and Odin knows that. The fact he didn\u2019t ask me is a downright
      insult. I\u2019m so sick and tired of these bigwig gods just ignoring us lesser
      gods."

    dialogue: "Now, now, it\u2019s good that you are expressing your feelings, but
      it would be very difficult to create lasting change in the world, particularly
      against the leaders of our pantheons."

    dialogue: "You know, you could use a scapegoat to shove all the blame onto someone
      in order to rile up the people, promising and promoting change. Then just use
      that angry crowd to simply lynch the people in power that you don\u2019t like."

    dialogue: "Enough! No one is going to be riling up any angry mobs. A far smarter
      strategy would be to break in with a small team and eliminate the top dog.
      There would be fewer consequences if we fail, plus it wouldn\u2019t involve
      crowd management."
